README for interested people in the patchouli migration:
- the plan is to dump the entries from the existing lexicon code
- but instead of putting in localized text in the page bodies (and other places), keep them as lang keys
- after the structure of the book is complete, then I'll write a script that reads everything in en_us, replaces all the
  lang keys with their real text, then outputs them to every language. that way we do the work once and get them for all langs
- custom components will be added as necessary to support all pages
- extra features like the dog or notes will be removed
- special reference features like haighyorkie's fish will be reimplemented in some way
