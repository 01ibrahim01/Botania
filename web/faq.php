If the footer isn't there, click the little + icon.<br><br>								<b>Can the flowers in this mod be retroactively generated?</b><br>				No, they can't, due to the method they use for generation. They're generated during biome decoration, so the amount of flowers depends on how many flowers would be in that biome to begin with. You can still get the mod's flowers easilly through creating Floral Fertilizer, which is a pretty early game item.<br><br>								<b>There's too many flowers! How do I lower the amount?</b><br>				I like how many flowers there are by default, so I'm not changing that. You can lower the frequency (how often they spawn) and the density (how many spawn at once for each "patch") in the config.<br><br>								<b>Could you add a config option to restrict flowers to specific biomes?</b><br>				Given that each flower is required for the progression, no, this seems like a terrible idea. I have no interest in doing this.<br><br>								<b>My Mana Pool's Mana isn't changing, I got a few Dayblooms producing and the bar doesn't move, what's wrong?</b><br>				The Mana Pool holds a lot of mana. Dayblooms produce a very little amount of it, so you probably won't even notice the difference in the bar. Go get some better flowers like Endoflames.<br><br>								<b>I found a bug, how do I report it?</b><br>				I made a <a href="http://vazkii.us/br101/">website</a> to teach people how to report bugs, read what's on there and then go report it on the <a href="https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania/issues">issue tracker</a>.<br><br>								<b>My console is getting spammed with "true" or "false" in the 1.6 version. How do I fix that?</b><br>				I accidentally a debug in, I fixed it in 1.7, if you don't want to update, don't place down Nightshades.<br><br>								<b>My game crashes with <a href="http://openeye.openmods.info/crashes/1dbc37884f9ac4ed8cce833186832e19">this log</a> or <a href="http://openeye.openmods.info/crashes/7f75eed23d85bb2d9a44393890c97cf3">this log</a>, what did I do wrong?</b><br>				You forgot to install the <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2535073-">Baubles API</a>, silly.<br><br>								<b>My game has been very laggy since I installed botania, how can I fix it?</b><br>				Go check the mod's config. Try turning off the shaders, if that doesn't help, try setting the flower particle frequency to 0. If that doesn't do it either then I really don't know what will.<br><br>								<b>Is there a Botania API? Can I make a Botania Addon?</b><br>				Yes, there is <a href="https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania/tree/master/MODSRC/vazkii/botania/api">an API</a>. When it comes to making addons, you can make them, but please give me a poke about what you're going to add. I hold no ability to disallow you to add some things, given the mod's license, but I at least like to know what's being done. It's not required though.<br>				One thing when it comes to make addons, please do not make a <a href="https://twitter.com/Vazkii/status/470941412079730688">Thaumcraft-Botania crossover</a> mod. When I say "crossover" mod I'm talking about a mod that firmly roots the mechanics of botania with those of thaumcraft. Mods like <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2305054-">Forbidden Magic</a> that just add small thaumcraft integration things are fine.<br><br>								<b>Why can't I make a Thaumcraft-Botania integration mod? (related to the last question)</b><br>				It's a weird psychological thing of mine. One of the reasons I dropped Thaumic Tinkerer, actually (yes, I used to make that...). When my work is effectively bound to someone else's work that's much more popular, of higher quality and higher on my own regard, I believe my work is no good and the only reason people use it is the fact that it's rooted against the other work. This might sound silly, but I really don't want to think about botania like that, it'd probably lead to me getting fed up with it and dropping it, much like it happened with TT.<br>				Furthermore, the TC addon "community" is a bunch of leeches who basically pile all of the terrible works people did, people who are less shameful than me and don't bother about making low quality projects as long as they're used widely. It just seems natural botania would be installed on a whim of "LETS PILE ALL THE TC ADDONS AND HAVE A BLAST", like I've seen quite a few (that generally end up disappointing), rather than people who actually find it good for what it is.<br>				This, of course, does not hold true for every TC addon user and/or creator. I know quite a few TC addon makers who are extremely talented, even more than me (which isn't really saying much, but whatever), as well as a bunch of extremely supportive and bright TC addon users. There's always a few exceptions to the rule, but in general, it doesn't look too bright over there. And no, I do not have any grude against Azanor or Thaumcraft, don't bother trying to create drama with that.			</div>		</div>				<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>		<script src="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>		<script src="jquery_cookie.min.js"></script>		<script> $(function() { $('#header-btn-faq').addClass('active'); }); </script>		<?php include 'incl/footer.php'; ?>	</body></html>
