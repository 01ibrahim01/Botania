*Fixed the block breaking particles of the creative mana pool being of the Livingrock Bricks.
*Having a Mana Void or any Catalyst below the Mana Pool changes it's texture.

*The Mana Blaster now has a subtle flicker effect on it's texture.

*Added <a href="https://twitter.com/Vazkii/status/484136285251309568">Matrix Mode</a> as a config option. This was a visual glitch I got while changing the particle code that I decided to leave in because it was funny.
r1.1 69
*Added a new lens (that requires elven knowledge), the Paintslinger Lens.

*Fixed the Soulscribe being able to be blocked with. <i>How does that even work anyway?</i>
*Fixed the config file re-saving if nothing changed.
*Renaming the Lexica Botania changes it's cover and title.

*Added the Manastar flower (under the Mana Manipulation section), which lets you measure if you're getting a profit or loss of mana.
*Droped the nerfhammer on Dayblooms and Nightshades. To start off, they're a bit slower by default now. They also suffer diminshing returns from having any flowers of the same type adjacent. Go get creative with better mana generation methods now.
*Moar references!
r1.0 45
*Temporarilly removed the auto downloader, the reason can be found <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2440071-botania-an-innovative-natural-magic-themed-tech-mod-not-in-beta-any-more/page__st__420#entry31815845">here</a>.
