botania:altgrass[variant={dry, golden, vivid, scorched, infused, mutated}]
=> botania:dry_grass
=> botania:golden_grass
=> botania:vivid_grass
=> botania:scorched_grass
=> botania:infused_grass
=> botania:mutated_grass
reason: each is a different variant

botania:storage[variant={manasteel, terrasteel, elementium, mana_diamond, terrasteel}]
=> botania:manasteel_block
=> botania:terrasteel_block
=> botania:elementium_block
=> botania:mana_diamond_block
=> botania:terrasteel_block
reason: each is a different variant

botania:forestdrum[variant={wild, gathering, canopy}]
=> botania:drum_wild
=> botania:drum_gathering
=> botania:drum_canopy
reason: each is a different variant

botania:custombrick[variant={azulejo_0, ..., azulejo_15}]
=> botania:azulejo_0
=> ...
=> botania:azulejo_15
(ordered 0, 13, 14, 15, then 1-12, due to legacy reasons)
reason: each is a different variant

botania:pool[variant={default, creative, diluted, fabulous}, color={16 colors}]
=> botania:mana_pool[color={16 colors}]
=> botania:creative_pool[color={16 colors}]
=> botania:diluted_pool[color={16 colors}]
=> botania:fabulous_pool[color={16 colors}]
reason: each is a different variant, but changing the color only can be done by using an item on a existing pool, so no need to flatten the colors out

botania:pylon[variant={mana, natura, gaia}]
=> botania:mana_pylon
=> botania:natura_pylon
=> botania:gaia_pylon
reason: each is a different variant

botania:platform[variant={abstruse, spectral, infrangible}]
=> botania:abstruse_platform
=> botania:spectral_platform
=> botania:infrangible_platform
reason: each is a different variant

botania:altar[variant={default, forest, plains, mountain, fungal, swamp, desert, taiga, mesa, mossy}]
=> botania:apothecary_<variant>
reason: each is a different variant. mossy moved from actual state read from TE to a real separate block

botania:opencrate[variant={open, crafty}, pattern={..}]
=> botania:opencrate
=> botania:craftcrate[pattern={..}]
reason: split open and crafty crate. Crafty patterns can stay blockstate properties since a pattern can only be changed by using an item on a existing crate

botania:petalblock[color={16 colors}]
=> botania:{color}_petal_block
reason: each is a different variant

botania:specialflower{nbt subtiles}
=> each will receive its own block ID.
=> subtiles still exist because the logic will need to be shared across normal/floating flowers etc.
=> there will also still be only one TE implementation (the benefits of flattening do not really apply much to TE's)
=> as before, addons should still be able to make their own subtile containers
=> however, the item and block forms of all flowers within botania will be flattened as it will simplify lots of logic
   => mostly, to get rid of NBT variants on the itemblocks and allow the ability to use the vanilla Tags system
   => addons are encouraged to flatten their standalone flowers
   => the Item and Block implementations should be simplified and moved to the API to allow addons to extend them
   => provide convenience methods in API to register a sane default Item and Block?
