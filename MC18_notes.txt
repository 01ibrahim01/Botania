-- API --
* Updated to BlockPos and EnumFacing everywhere where it made sense
* Registering repainting blocks will need to also receive a PropertyEnum with EnumDyeColor as the component type
so Botania knows what property to set the color on (todo actually do this)
* ICorporeaSpark.getInventory had to be changed to ICorporeaSpark.getSparkInventory because the signature clashed (IInventory vs ItemStack[], respectively)
This can be changed to match vanilla signature, but either would break backward compat.

-- Other --
* Most things left untouched to make patches from upstream easier
* Most uses of chunkcoordinates directly convert blockpos (THANK YOU VAZKII FOR USING THEM). Remove creation of extra instances
since BlockPos'es are immutable and thus can be reused everywhere.
* Some really needed fields in EntityItem are private now. Reflection time :(


-- Todo --
* Fix all the block signatures (easy)
* Fix all other low hanging errors (easy-med)
* Find all the block metadatas and give them all meaningful block states and properties (tedious/med-hard)
* JSON models for everything (tedious/med-hard)
* Migrate the PlayerRender events (baubles, etc.) to LayerRenderers (med)
