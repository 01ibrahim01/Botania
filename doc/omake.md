Profile: <Personality/Occupation/Hobbies>

## Pure Daisy
* Name: Pure Daisy
* Gender: Gender is irrelevant for flowers.
* Physical symbols: white, angel
* Blurb: Pure Daisy is the flower your parents always compared you to. They were the
  perfect-attendance flower, the spelling-bee champion flower, the all-A's flower. Doted
  on by everyone, Pure Daisy embraces both the expectations and the praise heaped onto
  themself and works hard. They work as an executive at a highly prestigious company (TODO
  doing what), and in their free time enjoys TODO. As a result of their perfectionism,
  Pure Daisy can easily get upset when things don't go according to plan.
* Likes: Things being orderly, precision, perfectionism
* Dislikes: Unexpected changes of plan, others not putting forth their full effort

## Manastar
Idea: data scientist

## Daybloom
* Gender: Male (he/him)
* Physical symbols: Setting Sun
* Likes: Fame, the grind, leadership, Nightshade, renewable energy
* Dislikes: Hydroangea

Daybloom was one of the hottest names in Minecraft, adored by his fanboys and fangirls,
and usually touring for ten months in a year with the band he formed with his cousin
Nightshade and high school friend Hydroangea.

A musical genius, Daybloom was the guitarist and lead vocalist, and the brains of the
entire operation. A tireless worker, Daybloom toiled day and night to get the band off of
the ground and into the limelight, juggling management duties with performance and
composition (because he didn't trust anyone else to do as good a job).

One fated day, deep into a tour in which every show was a sellout, Hydroangea approached
him and mentioned that they wanted to cut the tour short and return home due to excessive
stress. Daybloom was shocked, then panicked. Did Hydroangea not understand the commitments
that they had made, both to their fans and to their contract partners? This move would
cost them dearly and destroy all the plans he had laid out for the group in the next
two years.

Daybloom considered Hydroangea a good friend, but in the heat of the moment, he lost his
composure. The heated discussion ended with Hydroangea leaving for the next flight home.
Daybloom and Nightshade, in a struggle, managed to finish the tour with a backup drummer
and return home. Daybloom immediately began another round of planning; there was no time
to lose salvaging the group's plans. He attempted to recruit a new full-time drummer, but
after a few gigs that were panned as the worst of the band's history, it quickly became
clear that what the fans truly appreciated were the dynamic trio of brave and outspoken
Daybloom, demure and cute Nightshade, and stoic and thoughtful Hydroangea. Their best days
were now behind them.

With resignation, Daybloom announced his retirement. The group had made more than enough
in their several-year run for him to live the rest of his life comfortably, but Daybloom
ruminates on returning the industry quite often.

His feelings about Hydroangea remain complicated. On one hand, Hydroangea's departure was
the *de facto* reason the band broke up. On the other hand, he had come to understand and
somewhat empathize with Hydroangea's reasoning. Despite usually being the confident and
fearless leader during their performing years, he has not contacted Hydroangea since that
night. However, their phone number remains in his contacts list, and perhaps one day
Daybloom can muster up the confidence to tap the "Call" button.

## Nightshade
* Gender: Female (she/her)
* Physical symbols: New Moon
* Likes: Astrology, Daybloom, renewable energy
* Dislikes: Making decisions

The younger cousin of Daybloom, Nightshade served as bassist and occasional vocalist of
the group formed by the duo and their high school friend Hydroangea. She's known for her
cute yet reserved personality.

Nightshade often has decision paralysis and finds it hard to make major choices and
decisions. As a result, she often left much of the band's creative work to Daybloom
and Hydroangea.

This came to a head one night during a tour. Hydroangeas had come and requested a leave of
absence from the rest of the tour, which sent Daybloom into a panic. The conversation
escalated into an impassioned argument, in which Nightshade heard several sentences she
was sure both of them would regret saying sooner or later. But at the time, she felt
powerless to step between them. When all was said and done, Hydroangea had left the hotel,
and Daybloom was tearfully scrambling to figure out the logistics of such a drastic
change.

What if I had spoken up then?

Could I have kept the band together?

Those questions remains with Nightshade to this day. After Daybloom announced his
retirement, Nightshade quickly followed suit. With her earnings, she opened a small shop
where she gives psychic readings, astrological predictions, tarot card readings,
*fengshui* calculations, among other similar arts. She has rarely touched her bass since.

## Hydroangea
* Name: Hydroangea
* Gender: Fish (they/them)
* Physical symbols: Ripples
* Likes: Drumming, water, peace and quiet, meditation, self-reflection
* Dislikes: Large crowds, stress

Hydroangea was a drummer in high school, but never cared for making it big. In a massive
stroke of luck, they somehow befriended Daybloom, who quickly recognized Hydroangeas'
talent for the drumset and recruited them into his band. At first, the group played
small-time gigs in bars and clubs, but quickly made a name for themselves. From
hole-in-the-wall establishments, they went to auditoriums, to stadiums, to worldwide tours
within a year. Hydroangea happily went along with it, appreciating the new experiences
that came with each song, album, and tour.
  
The stresses of being world-famous quickly got to Hydroangea, however. Long hours
rehearsing, composing, recording, and touring quickly wore down on Hydroangea,
eventually leading to several panic attacks and visits to the psychiatrist.
  
One day, halfway through another grueling tour and after several long nights of thought,
Hydroangea made up their mind. They met with Daybloom and Nightshade in their hotel
room, and with sincerest apologies told the duo that Hydrangea would not be able to
continue with the group after the tour was over. Daybloom did not take it well:
  
* "What about the fans?"
* "Our contract extends for another two years!"
* "Everyone is counting on you"!
* "Please, just until our contract expires?"
* "You're not pulling your weight here!"
  
were among the phrases Hydroangea heard in the room that day. Hydroangeas was torn once
more between staying and going, but came to the realization that prioritizing their own
health and well-being was more important than the next paycheck or the next moment under
the spotlight.  Disappointed and saddened by their friends' lack of empathy, Hydroangea
gathered their belongings, thanked and apologized to each and every member of the crew,
and departed for home that night, knowing they would likely never see either Daybloom or
Nightshade in person again.

Today, Hydrangea lives a well-off life from the money made from the band's peak years, and
continues to drum under a pseudonym, though they explicitly keep it amateur and refuse all
offers to form a commercial group.

When not drumming, they can often be found soaking in a pool or splashing around in the
rain (miraculously, they've not managed to catch a cold from it yet). While water is their
favorite element, they tend to feel out of place at social gatherings -- right now, an
hour is about their limit for parties and such, after which they steal off for some alone
time.

## Daybloom and Nightshade Motif
* Gender: Varies

Since the band's breakup, many fans have missed the trio. This led to many impersonators
popping up, which the fanbase have nicknamed "Motifs". These impersonators are often able
to impressively imitate Daybloom and Nightshade's appearance and behavior, but are never
able to replicate their musical prowess. Notably absent are Hydroangea impersonators, as
Hydroangea put out a statement requesting fans to not impersonate them, and to instead
show their love by purchasing the band's old records and merch.

## Endoflame
* Name: Endoflame
* Gender: Too young to have one
* Physical symbols: Sichuan peppercorn, spicy Cheetos
* Blurb: Endoflame is a kid who has gained a modest following online for their ability to
  stoically eat literally anything and everything spicy, up to and including actual
  flaming chunks of coal. In real life, though, they're a bit lazy, and they don't really
  have many aspirations beyond getting to eat the next spicy thing.
* Likes: Spicy food, naps, meadows
* Dislikes: Anything that disrupts the above
* Image (?)

## Thermalily
* Name: Thermalily
* Gender: Small-time Flintstagram/BrikBlok influencer
* Physical symbols: Fire
* Blurb: Many find Thermalily, a small-time CorporeaNet entertainer, to be hot as hell at
  first-- before they meet the streamer's fiery temper. While they meant to be a variety
  YouSparker at first, they were soon inspired by the Endoflame's adventures in spice to
  take on the challenges of sampling various hot-sauces for themself. However, despite all
  their attempts, their spice tolerance has stayed atrocious, and after every sampling
  they invariably need a five-minute break, often accompanied by loud cursing.
* Likes: Streaming, parties, (ostensibly) spicy foods
* Dislikes: Trolls, their followers that send them weird messages
* Image (?)

## Rosa Arcana
Idea: TTRPG nerd

## Munchdew
Idea: Hardcore vegan

## Entropinnyum
* Name: Entropinnyum
* Gender: We asked them and they proudly handed us a card which was too singed to read
* Physical symbols: Fireworks, red, black, silver
* Blurb: Entropinnyum lives their life on the edge. They love exploring the risky, the
  unknown, and doing the things that others are too afraid of doing-- so much, in fact,
  that they've made a career out of it: they provide coaching for the various activities
  that they enjoy, helping others get a taste of their own exciting life. While this has
  given them a reputation of being overly reckless, in reality Entropinnyum knows their
  limits exactly, and never takes anything too far (often stopping right before the
  line). In fact, Entropinnyum despises those that actually *do* take things too far, in
  particular harboring a special hatred for illegally-traded explosives.
* Likes: Skydiving, scuba diving, hang-gliding, spelunking, urban exploration, pyrotechnics
* Dislikes: Doing any of the above illegally
* Image (?)

## Kekimurus
Idea: Sweets connoisseur that somehow is immune to diabetes

## Gourmaryllis
Idea: Nutritionist

## Narslimmus
Idea: plumber/adventurer

## Spectrolus
* Name: Spectrolus
* Gender: Fluid; varies based on day, mood, phase of the moon, most recent syzygy, and/or last meal eaten
* Physical symbols: Rainbow
* Blurb: Spectrolus loves every color of the rainbow, and loves every kind of
  love. They're an active member of various social justice initiatives, being a vocal
  proponent of activism in all its forms. Career-wise, Spectrolus is a connoisseur of fine
  ethically-spun wools, silks, and fabrics, using them to weave elaborate tapestries and
  articles of clothing. Although Spectrolus usually tries to eat a varied vegetarian diet,
  mutton is a guilty pleasure of theirs, and Spectrolus will scarf it down whenever given
  the opportunity.
* Likes: Skittles, tapestry, weaving, sewing, mutton
* Dislikes: Greyscale, bland colors, plastic
* Image (?)

## Rafflowsia

## Dandelifeon
* Name: Dandelifeon
* Gender: We asked and they enthusiastically gave us a lecture (with diagrams) on the
  homomorphism of gender identity to a generalizable infinitely-differentiable fractal
  manifold completely characterized by several characteristic points, then handed us a
  list of coordinates and sprinted down the hallway with a cheerful "Figure it out!"
* Physical symbols: Lambda sign
* Blurb: Dandelifeon is the eccentric young mathematics professor at the local university
  who specializes in the maths adjacent to theories of computation. (In practice, this
  means that students often get somewhat lost at their lectures.) Having worked through
  SICP at the age of 5 and graduated with a Ph. D at the age of 18, they rarely go out to
  socialize, preferring to instead bury themself in their studies. They spend their
  vanishingly little spare time ricing their Emacs installation, debating people online
  (often getting into pointless debates about languages with Heisei), and watching nerdy
  TV shows.
* Likes: Clojure, Haskell, Emacs
* Dislikes: Python, C/C++, software engineers who think theory is useless

## Shulk Me Not
Idea: likes hobbies with high skill ceiling (sports, skill games, etc.)

## Jaded Amaranthus

## Bellethorne
Idea: somewhat of an asshole

## Dreadthorne
Idea: somewhat of an asshole

## Heisei Dream
* Name: Heisei Dream
* Gender: Hot topic of debate on many forums they frequent; they give a different response to each inquiry
* Physical symbols: :trolled: emote
* Blurb: Heisei Dream is a master of the old school internet trolling, in what they
  believe is its original, purest, most tasteful meaning. They love making jokes that poke
  fun at various celebrities, topics in the news, and indeed themself. They do enjoy, on
  extremely rare occasion, baiting for flamewars on inconsequential topics (such as "iOS
  vs Android" and "should the toilet paper roll go inside or outside"). When not trolling,
  Heisei Dream takes their studies in internet sociology surprisingly seriously.
* Likes: KenM, Rick Astley (they're an actual fan of his music), The Onion
* Dislikes: Fake "trolling" (most of their friend-group's been subjected to the "shouting slurs doesn't count" rant at least thrice)
* Image (?)

## Tigerseye
* Name: Tigerseye
* Gender: Cat person
* Physical symbols: Pusheen
* Blurb: Nobody knows how Tigerseye manages to keep cats, since they are a flower, but
  they do. They have 11 very-spoiled cats that live luxurious lives filled with food and
  belly rubs. Tigerseye has sworn off dating and marriage for the rest of their life,
  saying that their fur babies will last them until the day they finally wilt and
  die. Career-wise, Tigerseye serves as a skilled prosecutor and specializes in
  prosecuting sexual abuse offenders.
* Likes: Cats, Miles Edgeworth from Ace Attorney
* Dislikes: Leafy greens
* Image (?)


## Orechid
Idea: miner

## Orechid Ignem
Idea: Orechid's senior

## Fallen Kanade
Idea: Canadian

* Physical symbols: Maple syrup (only the best)

## Exoflame
* Name: Exoflame
* Gender: Tastefully done eyeliner that renders their features extra androgynous
* Physical symbols: a party hat, but specifically the one from OSRS
* Blurb: Despite their floral nature, Exoflame is by far the social butterfly of the
  group. Despite planning all the fun parties, hangouts, and trips, they alway make
  concerted efforts to spend quality time with their friends and family (much to the
  chagrin of Endoflame, their introverted younger sibling). Nor is their energy is limited
  to group settings-- Exoflame listens attentively whenever friends turn to them for help,
  often offering positive support and thoughtful advice that's exactly what the friend
  needs to hear. As a result, Exoflame is deeply trusted by nearly everybody they know.
* Likes: Meeting new people, helping friends in need, Endoflame
* Dislikes: When hangout plans fall through
* Image (?)

## Agricarnation
Idea: farmer

## Hopperhock

## Tangleberrie

## Jiyuulia

## Labellia
Idea: Librarian

## Rannuncarpus
* Name: Rannuncarpus
* Gender: Removed--- it was only holding them back
* Physical symbols: Toy slap hands
* Blurb: Rannuncarpus is extremely skilled with their hands and loves anything requiring
  fine manual skill. Though a professional pianist by trade, Rannuncarpus also performs
  electronics repair on the side for supplemental income. Interestingly enough, though
  highly skilled while on the job, Rannuncarpus can be surprisingly clumsy and prone to
  accident in their private life. Even so, they have an easygoing attitude and are always
  happy to hook up their friends and family with free concerts (or repairs).
* Likes: Piano, building castles and other large structures in Minecraft
* Dislikes: Getting cold hands before work
* Image (?)

## Hyacidus
Idea: Pharmacist that isn't very good

## Pollidisiac
* Name: Pollidisiac
* Gender: Agender
* Physical symbols: Heart (the actual organ)
* Blurb: Pollidisiac is the ideal partner for many: attractive, intelligent, funny, and
  passionate. They are fascinated with sexuality, going as far as to get a Ph. D in
  it. However, Pollidisiac is actually asexual. They work as a researcher at a top-level
  university, and teach classes on sexuality. One of their favorite things is when
  students come into class on day 1 snickering and joking about the course content, but by
  the end of the semester can hold mature and respectful conversations about the topic.
* Likes: Their students
* Dislikes: People that try to date them after being rebuffed
* Image (?)

## Clayconia
* Name: Clayconia
* Gender: Very precisely blended portions of masculinity, femininity, and flower
* Physical symbols: Play-Doh
* Blurb: Clayconia is the local elementary schoolchild who is the master of the
  sandbox. They're able to create mindblowingly intricate and complex sandcastles, whether
  on the sandbox or the beach. Strangely, Clayconia doesn't think much about these. Their
  real focus is on modeling with clay. Play-Doh is the most readily available type
  available, though they hope to get into professional pottery once they get into high
  school. Clayconia also has an uncannily strange obsession with yoga. They have been
  enamored with it at an early age, and constantly ramble to their parents about their
  goal of achieving perfect *balance*.
* Likes: Beaches, sandboxes, yoga, symmetry
* Dislikes: Nonsymmetric or unbalanced things
* Image (?)

## Loonium
* Name: Loonium
* Gender: They buried it in Alaska but won't tell us where
* Physical symbols: treasure chest
* Blurb: Loonium is a chronic hoarder, collecting any and all sort of trinkets and
  treasures, regardless of value. They frequently procure new items from the dungeons
  Entropinnyum visits, and trades them with other flowers. Occasionally, Loonium will hide
  some of their more valuable treasures and design elaborate treasure hunts for others.
* Likes: Geocaching, MIT puzzle hunt
* Dislikes: Misplacing their items
* Image (?)


## Daffomill
* Name: Daffomill
* Gender:
* Physical symbols: Hand fan
* Blurb: Daffomill is always chasing the latest trends. They were one of the first users
  of Vine, was into K-Pop and Chinese animation before either was cool, and was the one
  that dragged their friends onto BrikBlok. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as
  Daffomill's day job is a social media manager. Daffomill has uncannily deep knowledge
  about whatever they're obsessed with at the moment, and are the go-to reference for any
  one who's out of the loop with the latest memes. Their dream is to attend every single
  concert of the international tour of their favorite Korean boyband, BTS (Big Tater
  Squad).
* Likes: K-Pop, V-Tubers, Fashion
* Dislikes: Antis of whatever they like at the moment
* Image (?)

## Vinculotus
Idea: mad scientist (ender tech)

## Spectranthemum
Idea: Stage magician (teleporting things)

## Medumone
(slows mobs down)

## Marimorphosis
Idea: Alchemist (but a modern nuclear scientist)

## Bubbell
* Name: Bubbell
* Gender:
* Physical symbols: Full-body plastic bubbles
* Blurb: An easy misconception is that Bubbell has a bright and bubbly personality, due to
  their name. In actuality, Bubbell is quite antisocial and avoids contact with most
  others. Bubbell spends their spare time at home watching dramas and chatting with
  internet friends, though they are careful to not reveal too much about themselves. (TODO
  needs refinement and distinguishing characteristics with Hydro)
* Likes: Social distancing, going to the spa, solo scuba diving, chatting with Hydroangea over IRC
* Dislikes: Parties
* Image (?)

## Solegnolia
Idea: sound/electrical engineer or physicist

* Name: Solegnolia
* Gender: Pronouns are thor/thom/thors (!!rdj they really like Thor)
* Physical symbols: Any of the symbols that go on a circuit diagram
* Blurb: 
* Likes: Technical Minecraft, Simping for Fourier, Jamming with Bergamute and Rannuncarpus
* Dislikes: Modded Minecraft (too easy)
* Image (?)

## Bergamute
* Name: Bergamute
* Gender:
* Physical symbols: Earmuffs
* Blurb: Bergamute has "mute" in their name, but they actually love music. Bergamute
  strives their hardest to keep life simple and free of unnecessary things. They speak
  rarely, but their friends and coworkers listen and take Bergamute seriously when they do
  do so. Bergamute is a music composer, not making much money, but enough to live on, and
  Bergamute is completely satisfied with that.
* Likes: The "lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to" YouTube livestream, frugality
* Dislikes: noise, greed, waste
* Image (?)
